        I am a results-driven, hard-working, and highly ambitious software developer
        with 3+ years of experience building full-stack, user-centric web
        applications. My core tech stack is the MERN stack, and I am constantly
        learning, testing and adapting to new technologies to stay up to date on
        more efficient and scalable solutions. I relentlessly pursue goals with
        a first-principles approach, focusing on performance, an intuitive user
        experience, followed by possibilities for automation.
