        I am a results-driven, hard-working, and highly ambitious software
        developer with 3+ years of experience building full-stack, user-centric
        web applications. My core tech stack is the MERN stack, and I am
        constantly learning, testing and adapting to new technologies to stay up
        to date on more efficient and scalable solutions. I relentlessly pursue
        goals with a first-principles approach, focusing on performance, an
        intuitive user experience, followed by possibilities for automation. ðŸš€
